For the course project we were given a large, unorganized data set to clean, referred to as the Samsung data.

There were two files to be merged: "test/X_test.txt" and "train/X_train.txt" And descriptions of the data were included in the files: "test/y_test.txt", "train/y_train.txt", "test/subject_test.txt", "train/subject_train.txt", "features.txt", "activity_labels.txt"

"tidydata.txt" and "tidydataaverages.txt" are sample outputs from the "run_analysis.R" file. The "run_analysis.R" file will create those two files, if the Samsung data are in the wd.

CodeBook.md has detailed information about variables and the methods runanalyses.R uses to Clean the data.
